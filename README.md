How it was made:

It is mostly frontend static content with a few additional React features. Some content is lazy loaded because I have so many images here. The contact form is not a backend but a dependency I found called Formspree.

Most of the animations are intersection observers with preconfigured classes being added that have css animations.

I experimented with a few different color themes but I like the classy black and white. It feels clean.
