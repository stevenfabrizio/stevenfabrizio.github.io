# How It Works

It is mostly frontend static content with a few additional React features. Some content is lazy loaded because I have so many images here. The contact form is not a backend but a dependency I found called Formspree.

Most of the animations are intersection observers with preconfigured classes being added that have css animations.


# Future Improvements

Maybe use a more complicated design. The point of this is just to show some projects and some information. But the basic layout works for now. Maybe also update with a more responsive navbar.
